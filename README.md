# hello-world
This is my very first repository in GitHub. First of many, many projects.

My name is Maximillian. I'm an Electrical Engineering graduate from Cal Poly Pomona who has recently discovered that I desire a path in Software Engineering. I have past experience in C/C++, Java, HTML, and css from school projects and classes, but I am striving to become an Python expert. I have finished the Udemy 2020 Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python by Jose Portilla. I am nowhere near where I want to be, but it is a great milestone for me. My next project is going to be a website and then possibly a pathfinding program. I believe programming is going to change my life and I'm excited my growth. Thank you for taking the time to read my read-me, hopefully it's because I have impressed you with some code. If not, I got to work harder!
